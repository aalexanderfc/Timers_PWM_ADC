# Timers, PWM, and ADC Project

This repository contains a project demonstrating the use of Timers, Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), and Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC) on a microcontroller. This project is intended for embedded systems enthusiasts who want to understand how to utilize these core microcontroller features effectively.

## Features

- **Timers**: Configure and use hardware timers to generate precise delays and trigger actions.
- **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)**: Generate PWM signals for controlling peripherals such as LEDs or motors.
- **ADC (Analog-to-Digital Conversion)**: Read analog signals from sensors and convert them to digital values for further processing.

## Requirements

- **Hardware**: Microcontroller (e.g., ESP32, STM32, or Arduino)
- **Software**: 
  - Arduino IDE or PlatformIO (for ESP32/Arduino)
  - Necessary drivers for your microcontroller

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aalexanderfc/Timers_PWM_ADC.git
   cd Timers_PWM_ADC
   ```

2. **Open the Project**:
   - For Arduino IDE, open the `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
   - For PlatformIO, open the project folder in VS Code.

3. **Connect Your Hardware**:
   - Set up your microcontroller on a breadboard.
   - Connect the necessary sensors or components for PWM or ADC functionality.

4. **Configure Pins (Optional)**:
   - Modify the pin assignments and parameters in the code to match your specific hardware configuration.

5. **Upload the Code**:
   - Connect your microcontroller to your computer via USB.
   - Compile and upload the code to your board.

## Usage

- **Timers**: The project demonstrates setting up hardware timers to trigger actions at set intervals.
- **PWM**: The PWM signal can be used to control devices such as LEDs (brightness) or motors (speed).
- **ADC**: Use the ADC functionality to read analog values, such as temperature or light level from sensors.

## How It Works

This project showcases how to configure and use timers, PWM, and ADC functionalities on a microcontroller:

- **Timers**: Used to create precise delays and to periodically trigger specific tasks.
- **PWM**: Used to generate a signal that can control the speed of a motor or the brightness of an LED.
- **ADC**: Converts analog input from sensors into a digital value that the microcontroller can process.

## Example Code

Here is a brief example of what the code looks like:

```cpp
void setup() {
    // Setup code for Timers, PWM, and ADC
}

void loop() {
    // Main loop code for reading ADC and controlling PWM
}
```

For detailed code, please refer to the specific `.ino` file in the repository.

## Limitations

- This project is targeted at microcontrollers that support timers, PWM, and ADC functionalities.
- The configuration may vary slightly depending on the specific microcontroller being used.
